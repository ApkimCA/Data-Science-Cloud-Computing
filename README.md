## Objective:
The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine AML protein of interest through identification of protein-protein interactions. This comes with a task for our company, BCR, to discover target proteins and develop novel drugs that disrupt pathways connected to progression of Acute Myeloid Leukemia. The Beat AML program will supply the datasets related to patient attributes, AML status, gene/protein ID, inhibitory drug ID, IC50, and cell response to drug treatment. Once the AML gene/protein profile is established, then protein interaction, localization, and abundance information from OpenCell will be employed to determine strength of AML protein binding interactions. Discovered proteins that bind strongly to known AML proteins will be verified against scientific literature for historical relevance and confirmation.

## Datasets:
Source data will come from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub OpenCell database and Beat AML program derived from the Cancer Target Discovery and Development Data Portal.

## Description of datasets:
The tables range from 11kB to 4.6MB of datasets. The data as CSV files will be uploaded and stored in a Github repository. The data will also be stored in Amazon S3, which will involve creating and specifying a bucket within Amazon Web Services (AWS) Region before the data is uploaded to the specified bucket as objects in S3.

## Programming Languages:
AWS Cloud Computing Services (SageMaker Studio, S3, Athena), Jupyter Notebooks/Python
